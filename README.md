# the-ultimate-nextjs-project-starter

A clean, complete, and professionally crafted template/boilerplate for starting new NextJs projects.

> Please note that this template is yet to be completed. It's still a work in progress, but it's quite good enough to help bootstrap your project already.

## How to use this template in Four(4) simple steps.

1. create a new repository with it by using the green "use this template" button at the top-right corner of the screen on Github.

2. clone the project.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/Okpainmo/the-ultimate-nextjs-project-starter
```

3. install all dependencies and dev-dependencies using npm(or your preferred package manager - npm is recommended).

```shell
npm install
```

4. Ensure that husky is enabled, to have your project follows the installed code and contribution standards. Run the below command.

```shell
npx husky init
```

**That is all there is. You're good to go!!!**

> Remember to support the repository with a star, and make a fork for yourself if you so wish.

Cheers!
